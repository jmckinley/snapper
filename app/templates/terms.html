    <!-- 1. Acceptance -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">By accessing, downloading, installing, or using Snapper ("the Software"), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to all of these Terms, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and delete all copies in your possession.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User," "you," or "your") and McKinley Labs LLC ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <!-- 2. Description -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">Snapper is an Agent Application Firewall (AAF) that inspects and enforces security policy on AI agent traffic. It provides rule-based control, PII protection, approval workflows, and audit logging for AI agents including OpenClaw, Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, and custom agents.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 font-semibold">Snapper is a security tool, not a security guarantee. The Software is designed to reduce risk, not eliminate it. You acknowledge that AI agent security is an evolving field and that no tool can provide absolute protection against all threats.</p>

    <!-- 3. License -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. License</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Snapper is open-source software licensed under the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" class="text-primary-600 hover:text-primary-800 underline">MIT License</a>. The MIT License governs your right to use, copy, modify, and distribute the Software. These Terms govern additional conditions of use.</p>

    <!-- 4. Assumption of Risk -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Assumption of Risk</h2>
    <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
        <p class="text-red-800 font-bold text-sm uppercase">You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Software is at your sole risk.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">By using Snapper, you assume full responsibility for:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Selecting, configuring, testing, and maintaining security rules appropriate for your environment</li>
        <li>Protecting your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code>, API keys, database credentials, and all other secrets</li>
        <li>Securing your deployment infrastructure (firewall, TLS, network access controls, operating system hardening)</li>
        <li>Backing up your data, encryption keys, and database contents regularly</li>
        <li>Evaluating whether the Software meets your security, compliance, and regulatory requirements</li>
        <li>Monitoring the Software's operation and responding to security events</li>
        <li>Keeping the Software and all dependencies up to date with security patches</li>
        <li>Testing the Software thoroughly in a non-production environment before deploying to production</li>
        <li>Understanding the security implications of every rule, configuration, and integration you enable</li>
        <li>Any and all consequences arising from AI agent actions, whether or not those actions were evaluated by Snapper</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 5. No Guarantee of Security -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. No Guarantee of Security</h2>
    <div class="bg-red-50 border border-red-200 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
        <p class="text-red-800 font-bold text-sm uppercase">The Software does not and cannot guarantee security of any kind.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">While Snapper is designed to enhance AI agent security, you expressly acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Snapper does not replace proper network security, access controls, intrusion detection, or security monitoring</li>
        <li>Snapper may fail to detect, block, or flag malicious, unauthorized, or unintended agent actions</li>
        <li>Snapper may fail to detect all PII, sensitive data, or confidential information in agent traffic</li>
        <li>Snapper depends entirely on correct configuration to be effective; misconfiguration may result in no protection or a false sense of security</li>
        <li>Snapper should be used as <strong>one layer</strong> in a defense-in-depth security strategy, never as the sole security measure</li>
        <li>New attack vectors, AI agent behaviors, or software vulnerabilities may emerge that Snapper does not address</li>
        <li>Rule evaluation, approval workflows, and blocking mechanisms may fail due to software bugs, infrastructure failures, race conditions, network issues, or other technical problems</li>
        <li>The absence of a blocked action in Snapper's logs does not mean the action was safe, authorized, or desirable</li>
        <li>Snapper's hook scripts depend on the correct functioning of third-party agent frameworks, and changes to those frameworks may break Snapper's protections without warning</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 6. Disclaimer of Warranties -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <div class="bg-gray-50 border border-gray-300 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">

    </ul>

    <!-- 7. Data Handling -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">7. Data Handling and Privacy</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Snapper processes and stores the following data locally in your infrastructure:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li><strong>Audit logs</strong> of agent actions (commands, file access, network requests)</li>
        <li><strong>PII vault entries</strong> encrypted with Fernet (AES-128-CBC) derived from your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code></li>
        <li><strong>Agent metadata</strong> including API keys (stored as SHA-256 hashes)</li>
        <li><strong>Approval workflow state</strong> in Redis (with configurable TTL)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">All data is stored in your own PostgreSQL and Redis instances. Snapper does not transmit data to external servers operated by us. However, if you configure external alerting (Telegram, Slack, email, webhooks, PagerDuty), data may be transmitted to those third-party services.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3 font-semibold">You are solely responsible for ensuring your use of Snapper complies with all applicable data protection laws and regulations, including but not limited to GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and any other relevant privacy legislation.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We are not responsible for data breaches, data loss, or unauthorized access to data stored by Snapper, regardless of cause.</p>

    <!-- 8. PII Vault -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">8. PII Vault and Encryption</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-3">The PII vault encrypts sensitive data using a key derived from your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code> via HKDF.</p>
    <div class="bg-yellow-50 border border-yellow-300 rounded-lg p-4 mb-4">
        <p class="text-yellow-800 font-bold text-sm">CRITICAL WARNING: Changing, losing, or compromising your SECRET_KEY after storing vault entries will make all encrypted vault data permanently and irreversibly unrecoverable. No recovery mechanism exists.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Securely generating, storing, and backing up your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code></li>
        <li>Protecting your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code> from unauthorized access</li>
        <li>Understanding that the encryption strength depends on the secrecy and strength of your <code class="bg-gray-100 px-1 rounded text-sm">SECRET_KEY</code></li>
        <li>Evaluating whether the encryption mechanisms meet your compliance and security requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">We make no representations about the strength, adequacy, or suitability of the encryption algorithms used. Cryptographic standards evolve, and what is considered secure today may not be secure in the future.</p>

    <!-- 9. Third-Party -->
    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">9. Third-Party Integrations and Dependencies</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Snapper integrates with third-party services and depends on third-party software. You acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 mb-4 space-y-1">
        <li>Third-party integrations (Telegram, Slack, PagerDuty, GitHub, NVD) are subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies</li>
        <li>We are not responsible for the availability, reliability, accuracy, or security of any third-party service</li>
        <li>Third-party services may change their APIs, terms, or behavior at any time, which may break Snapper's integrations</li>
        <li>Snapper depends on third-party software libraries, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies may affect the security of the Software</li>
        <li>Agent hook scripts depend on the specific behavior of third-party AI agents (Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Claude Code, OpenClaw), which may change without notice</li>
    </ul>
